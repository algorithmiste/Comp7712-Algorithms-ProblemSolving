----> The first line should be a positive integer n, representing the number of vertices of the graph.
----> The next few lines will contain the edges of the graph as i,j where 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= n and i != j.
----> The LAST line should be: 0,0 and indicates the termination of the input.


**IF YOU PLAN TO RUN BY MANUALLY ENTERING EACH LINE OF THE INPUT:
1. Run Problem1.java
2. You will be prompted to "Enter a directed graph: "
